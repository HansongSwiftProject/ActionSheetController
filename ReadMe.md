AcionSheetController
====

AcionSheetController is an iOS control for presenting a view in an iOS action sheet or alert style. You can add a custom view, representing your custom content, and add any number of buttons to represent actions related to that content. You can also forgo any custom view and simply present a number of actionable buttons.

AcionSheetController is written in **Swift** and was inspired by [RMActionController](https://github.com/CooperRS/RMActionController) by [Roland Moers](https://github.com/CooperRS). AcionSheetController differs in a number of aspects, firstly, of course, by being written in Swift, and also importantly by basing itself on **UIStackView**.

Usage
====
By default ActionSheetController doesn't contain a content view, and will only show buttons for any actions you add. To show a content view you simply set the contentView property to hold the desired view. There is generally no need to subclass ActionSheetController, although you can if you want to.

### Adding a view
Lets say you want to add a date picker:
- You instantiate a UIDatePicker
- You instantiate an action and consult the date picker in its handler, to extract the selected date.
- You set the picker as the content view of the ActionSheetController

```swift
private func datePickerSheet() -> ActionSheetController {
        let pickerView = UIDatePicker(frame: CGRectZero)

        let okAction = ActionSheetControllerAction(style: .Done, title: "OK", dismissesActionController: true) { controller in
            let date = pickerView.date
            let action = AlertAction(title: "Hurray!", style: .Default, enabled: true, isPreferredAction: true) {
                print("Dismissed!")
            }
            let alertInfo = AlertInfo(title: "Success", message: "You picked date: \(date.description)", actions: [action])
            AlertPresenter.sharedAlertPresenter.addAlert(alertInfo)
        }
        
        let cancelAction = ActionSheetControllerAction(style: .Cancel, title: "Cancel", dismissesActionController: true, handler: nil)
        let sheetController = ActionSheetController(title: "Date Picker", message: "Pick a date for your enjoymentâ€¦", cancelAction: cancelAction, okAction: okAction)
        
        sheetController.contentView = pickerView
        
        return sheetController
    }
```
### Presenting
Presenting the controller is pretty standard:

```swift
        var sheetController = self.datePickerSheet()
        self.controller.presentViewController(sheetController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

### Presentation Style
ActionSheetController can be presented as a popover on iPad, and it has a light and a dark theme, suitable for different context, and/or personal preference.

### Integration
To use ActionSheetController simply drag the files ActionSheetController.swift and ActionSheetControllerAction.swift into your project.
